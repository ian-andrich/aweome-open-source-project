# Awesome Open Source Project
An Awesome List for making hosting, growing, and ensuring the success of your open source project.

Contains tooling, and checklists related to ensuring that your open source project is successful.

This gives you an eye for where your project needs to evolve to in order to mature and be succesful.

Too many guides are too static in their analysis of where your project ***is*** and where your project needs to wind up.

# Immediate Goals
Begin filling out checklists

Double check quality

Establish community guidelines, contributor crediting system.

I know this will be too specific starting out, but I don't know where the cuts will be to make this appropriately general to suit most possible open source projects, so guidance will start out focusing on software.

Get this to the point where it is sufficiently well defined that I can start accepting contributors.


***Get it to the point where I can begin reaching out to the community for their wisdom.***

# Long Term Goals
Turn this into a healthy community curating a list of best practices and tooling relevant to people increasing their quality of open source contributions.
Establish a roadmap for each version of the document.
