# Awesome Open Source Project
An Awesome List for making, hosting, growing, and ensuring the success of your open source project.

Contains tooling, and checklists related to ensuring that your open source project is successful.

This gives you an eye for where your project needs to evolve to in order to mature and be succesful.

Too many guides are too static in their analysis of where your project ***is*** and where your project needs to wind up.

# Big Picture
* Open community

## Starting Out Checklist
- [ ] Who will use it?
- [ ] Why would they benefit?  Why use *this* and not *that* project.
- [ ] What environments will they use it on? What will they do with it?
- [ ] How can they contribute? Provide bug reports?
- [ ] Choose a name
- [ ] Choose a license
- [ ] Sketch community engagement policy.
- [ ] Initial Project Skeleton for deployment
- [ ] Initialize dev environment for development.
- [ ] Initial Testing Skeleton/Environment.

## Young Project Checklist
- [ ] Build 4 avatars of your users -- who do you think they are?  How do they feel?  How does this help them specifically?
- [ ] Functioning prototype.

# Immediate Goals
- [ ] Begin filling out checklists
- [ ] Double check quality
- [ ] Establish community guidelines, contributor crediting system.


I know this will be too specific starting out, but I don't know where the cuts will be to make this appropriately general to suit most possible open source projects, so guidance will start out focusing on software.

Get this to the point where it is sufficiently well defined that I can start accepting contributors.


***Get it to the point where I can begin reaching out to the community for their wisdom.***

# Long Term Goals
Turn this into a healthy community curating a list of best practices and tooling relevant to people increasing their quality of open source contributions.
Establish a roadmap for each version of the document.
